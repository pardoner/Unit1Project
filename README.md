# Unit1Project - Personal Website
Hello! Welcome to my Unit 1 project with the Grace Hopper Program. The purpose of this project was to develop a personal webpage containing an index/landing page, an about me page, and a portfolio. I initially created this page using HTML, then later stylized it by linking a CSS page and adding a alert with Javascript. 

On the first page you can find a navigation system of links giving the user a choice of clicking on the index, about, or portfolio page. Upon clicking the link, the user should be taken to the page associated with the index system. The index page also contains a set of website rules in an unordered list, by following these rules the user will have the best web experience. The about me page shares some information on the creator and a couple images. On the portfolio page, a few images can be found as well as links to additional websites. These images and websites represent creative goals of the creator. 

A complicated element to this project was griding, but I'm developing a stronger grip on it and am happy with the way things turned out. 

It's recommended to open this project in VS Code and to preview with a web browser.
